## Introduction

- Two narratives of post colonial economic development
  - Macro indicators
  - Succession of regimes

- Both the narratives are important.


# The four regimes of accumulation in Independent India (1947-2011)

## India on the Eve of Independence

- Destroyed traditional industries
- Deindustrialised the country.
- Left the country with challenges:
  - Self sufficiency in agriculture
  - Heterogeneous groups and their vested interests
  - Technological dependence on the metropolitan economies.

---

*FERA: Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973*

- FERA was a crucial piece of legislation enacted by the Indian government to <u>regulate foreign exchange transactions and control the outflow of foreign currency from the country</u>.

- Its implementation aimed to <u>stabilize the Indian economy</u>, which was facing challenges in managing foreign exchange reserves and preventing capital flight.

- FERA played a significant role in India's economic policies until it was eventually replaced by FEMA in 1998.

---

**Historical Context**

*Pre-FERA Economic Challenges*

- Before the enactment of FERA, India struggled with <u>balance of payments issues and a shortage of foreign exchange reserves.</u>
- There was an urgent need to <u>curb the illegal transfer of foreign currency and control capital flight</u>, which was affecting the stability of the Indian rupee.


*Example: Balance of Payments Crisis*

- In the late 1960s, India faced a severe balance of payments crisis due to <u>rising import bills and a decline in exports.</u>
- The crisis led to a substantial <u>depletion of foreign exchange reserves</u>, prompting the need for <u>stricter foreign exchange regulations.</u>


---

**Objectives of FERA**

*Controlling Foreign Exchange Transactions*

- FERA aimed to control and regulate foreign exchange transactions to ensure stability in the foreign exchange market.
- It authorized the government to impose restrictions on the movement of foreign currency in and out of India.

*Conserving Foreign Exchange*

- The conservation of foreign exchange was a critical objective of FERA. The act sought to conserve India's limited foreign exchange reserves for essential imports and development projects.

---

**Key Provisions of FERA**

*Regulation of Foreign Exchange Transactions*

- FERA empowered the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to <u>regulate all foreign exchange transactions</u>, including the conversion of Indian currency into foreign currency and vice versa.
- Any person or entity engaging in such transactions had to comply with RBI's regulations.

*Control over Foreign Securities*

- The act prohibited Indian residents from holding foreign securities without RBI's permission.
- It aimed to prevent the outflow of capital through investments in foreign financial instruments.

*Restrictions on Dealings in Foreign Exchange*

- FERA imposed restrictions on the possession and utilization of foreign currency within India.
- Non-compliance with these regulations could lead to penalties or legal actions.

---

**Amendments to FERA**

*1976 Amendment*

- The 1976 amendment to FERA strengthened the penalties for violations and introduced stricter enforcement measures.
- This amendment addressed the need for more effective deterrents against illegal foreign exchange activities.

*1993 Amendment*

- The 1993 amendment allowed for compounding of certain offenses, enabling offenders to settle their cases by paying a compounding fee.
- This move aimed to reduce the burden on courts and expedite the resolution of cases.

---

**Repeal of FERA**

*Reasons for Repeal*

- FERA faced criticism for being a <u>draconian law</u>, leading to the misuse of its provisions by authorities.
- The government recognized the <u>need for more liberalized foreign exchange regulations</u> to attract foreign investments and promote economic growth.

*Introduction of FEMA*

- In 1998, FERA was repealed, and the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) was introduced to replace it.
- FEMA marked a significant shift towards a more modern and market-oriented approach to foreign exchange regulations.

---

**Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA)**

*Objectives and Scope*

- FEMA aimed to facilitate external trade, promote foreign investments, and maintain orderly foreign exchange markets.
- It streamlined and simplified foreign exchange regulations while aligning them with economic reforms.

**Comparison: FERA vs. FEMA**

*Differences and Improvements*

- FEMA introduced a more liberalized and business-friendly approach to foreign exchange regulations compared to the stringent provisions of FERA.
- The act emphasized promoting economic growth and easing foreign exchange transactions for individuals and businesses.

---

**Impact on Indian Economy**

*FERA's Impact*

- FERA played a crucial role in <u>curbing illegal foreign exchange activities</u> during its existence.
- However, its stringent provisions <u>sometimes hindered foreign investments</u> and discouraged foreign businesses from operating in India.

*FEMA's Impact*

- After the introduction of FEMA, India witnessed an <u>increase in foreign investments</u> and a boost in international trade.
- The liberalized foreign exchange regime under FEMA contributed to India's economic growth and integration into the global economy.

---

**Case Studies**

*Case 1: Harshad Mehta Scam*

- The infamous Harshad Mehta stock market scam ([1992 Indian stock market scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Indian_stock_market_scam)) in the early 1990s involved the violation of FERA provisions.
- Mehta used loopholes in the system to manipulate the stock market and divert funds illegally.

---

*Case 2: Hawala Transactions*

- FERA was used to prosecute individuals involved in illegal hawala transactions, where money was transferred through informal networks without proper documentation.

**Green revolution and populism (1967-80): Class dynamics and distributional effects**

- Growth of certain crops and regions under Green Revolution.
- Large landholders and the *rural elite* benefited the most.

  ![](2.GrowthAndDistributionRegimes/Table3.PNG)


---

**Green revolution and populism (1967-80): Class dynamics and distributional effects**

- *Rural rich* emerged $\rightarrow$ increased powers $\rightarrow$ formation of Interest Groups (politically motivated).
  - For instance Lok Dal (led by [Charan Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charan_Singh)) that would go on to dethrone Congress in 1978.

- Subsidies $\uparrow$ $\rightarrow$ public investment in industries $\downarrow$
- Green revolution $\rightarrow$ rural inequality
  - Compensatory policies: [Garibi hatao](https://indiragandhi.in/en/timeline/index/garibi-hatao-timeline)
- 1970s:
  - PDS
  - IRDP
- Poverty declined from 50% to 40%

---


**Public Distribution System (PDS) in India - An Overview**


- The Public Distribution System (PDS) in India is a government-led initiative aimed at ensuring food security and reducing hunger by providing subsidized food grains to eligible beneficiaries.
- PDS plays a crucial role in addressing food inequality and poverty in the country.


**Historical Context**

- The PDS was introduced in India in the 1940s during the Second World War to distribute food grains efficiently and equitably.
- Over the years, the system has undergone several reforms and changes to make it more effective and inclusive.

**Key Objectives of PDS**

- Ensure Food Security: The primary goal of the PDS is to provide subsidized food grains to vulnerable sections of the population, especially those below the poverty line.
- Price Stabilization: PDS helps stabilize food prices in the market by procuring food grains from farmers at minimum support prices (MSP) and distributing them at subsidized rates.
- Poverty Alleviation: By providing affordable food grains, PDS aims to alleviate poverty and reduce hunger.

**Components of PDS**

- Targeted Public Distribution: PDS categorizes beneficiaries into priority and non-priority groups to ensure more focused assistance for the neediest.
- Fair Price Shops (FPS): The distribution of food grains happens through a network of FPS, which are authorized retail outlets.
- Food Grains Distribution: Rice, wheat, and other essential commodities are distributed through the PDS.

**Identification of Beneficiaries**

- BPL (Below Poverty Line) and AAY (Antyodaya Anna Yojana) cards are used to identify eligible beneficiaries.
- Recently, some states have adopted the SECC (Socio-Economic Caste Census) data for more accurate targeting.


**Recent Reforms and Developments**

- Aadhaar Integration: Linking PDS with Aadhaar (unique identification number) has helped reduce leakages and streamline beneficiary identification.
- End-to-End Computerization: Implementing technology-driven solutions has improved transparency and accountability.
- One Nation, One Ration Card (ONORC): The ONORC scheme allows beneficiaries to access PDS benefits across states, providing greater flexibility.

**Impact of PDS**

- Despite challenges, PDS has played a significant role in reducing hunger and improving food security for millions of Indians.
- It acts as a safety net for vulnerable populations during times of economic hardship and natural disasters.
