Chapter 13 [Plan, But Do Not Over Plan: Lessons for NITI Aayog](4.PlanningInIndia/pranabSen.pdf)


## The Planning Experience in India
- Devolution of the Planning Commission & replacement with NITI Aayog 
- Narendra Modi's speech on 15 Aug 2014
- GOI announces the formation of NITI aayog on 1 January 2015.
- Old style central planning out and new style reform agenda was in.
- A market-led process of growth and development
- Develop and 15 year vision, 7 year strategy and 3 year implementation framework.


---

- The 1st FYP was an agenda and not a plan
- Limitations during the 2nd FYP
  - savings, growth theories
- Original concept of Mahalanobis and Nehru
- Belief in the technocrats.
- A phased reduction of the savings constraint.
- The 3rd FYP conceived during a period of emerging BoP crisis
- A new constraint evolves: foreign exchange
- Two ways to address this crisis:
  - Increase exports
  - Reduce imports
- Would derail the strategy of increasing savings and long-run productivity.

---

- The 3rd FYP introduced Import Substitution Policy
- Partly political and partly technocratic.
- Received considerable attention and acclaim from politicians, academicians, and policymakers.
- 2 important developments:
  - Decentralised Planning
  - Detailed sectoral planning
- The 4th FYP was implemented amidst droughts, famines, and wars.
- Food security at the forefront of planning.
- Sustained industrialisation not possible without wage-goods.
- A third constrained introduced: wage-goods


---

- The 5th FYP recognised that growth and industrialisation alone would not eradicate poverty.
- Echoed in the slogan *Garibi Hatao*
- An extra element to the objectives of the plan.
  - Concept of *minimum needs*
  - Directed anti-poverty programmes.
- The 6th FYP recognised the successess of the Mahalanobis model
  - The savings constraint was now no longer binding.
  - Excess capacities created
- A shift in the pattern of industrialisation.
- Shift towards a more technocratic planning.


---

- The 7th FYP was an *infrastructure* plan.
- Shift to liberal trading regimes.
- Strategic planning by the political leadership
- The 8th FYP saw the economic crisis of 1991.
- Market-oriented planning
- Economy performed well
- The growth momentum could not be carried to the 9th FYP.
- 9th FYP recognised the importance of private investment.
- Added a fourth constraint: the financial constraint.
  - A weak financial sector can deprive the economy of optimal utilisation of the resources.
- Fiscal policy brought under the planning ambit.


---


- The Fifth Pay Commission weakened investment.
- Agriculture failure + Tight monetary policy also weakened investment
- The 10th FYP was a visionary plan.
- Emerging situation of demographic pattern
 - Steady reduction in the rate of growth of population in India, but a high growth of working age population.
- Challenges: 
  - Provide employment opportunities to this fast growing population.
  - Address the spatial pattern of creating jobs.
- Strong public intervention required in the infrastructure.



---


- Insights from the 10th FYP seen in the 11th FYP
 - Inclusive growth
 - Unemployment and infrastructure
 - Human resources
- Growth 9%
  - Shortages of *skills*.
- The Global Financial Crisis 2008 & Eurozone Crisis 2011
- Drought in 2009
- 12th FYP: Lost growth momentum
- Slowing down of corporate investment
-  Efforts to revive private investment sentiments
- National Institution for Transforming India (2015)


---

- Mandate of the NITI Aayog
  - Framing the vision by the technocrats
- Indian experience
  - Framing vision by the political class have been relatively successful.
  - The 2nd to 5th FYPS and the 10th FYP have had political visions (implemented at the technocrat levels).
  - No good strategic planning can occur in the absence of a challenging and well articulated vision.
- 3 critical characteristics of a vision statement:
  - Capture the imagination of the nation.
  - Full political commitment.
  - Thinking beyond mere extrapolations.
- On this count, NITI has been started on a wrong foot.
