## Reference
- [Inequities in Access to Health Services in India](7.Health/baru.pdf), Baru et al. (2008) Economic and Political Weekly

## Highlights
- Progress in advancing the health status extremely slow and uneven.
- Large inequalities in health and access to health services.
- Three forms of inequities
  1. Historical inequities
  2. Socio-economic inequities
  3. Inequities in the availability, utilisation, and affordability of health services.
  
## Introduction
- Accelerated economic growth but poor achievements in health
- Caste as an important determinant of socio-economic inequities in nearly all spheres of wellbeing
- SC's comprise roughly 16% of population and 8% of them are ST's
  - Mostly living in rural areas
  - Mostly comprise of landless agricultural labourers.
  - Suffer economic and social deprivation.
- Under Five Mortality Rate (U5MR)
  - Mortality among children younger than 5 years.
  - [NFHS](http://rchiips.org/nfhs/) (2005-06) reveals sharp regional and socio-economic divides.
  - Lower castes bear the burden of mortality disproportionately.

- High rates of U5MR associated with income and female population.
- U5MR of the richest income quintile earners is three times lower than the poorest quintile.

- Annual rate of reduction in U5MR
  - Between 1998-99 to 2005-06
    - Among ST's : 3.9%
    - Among SC's : 4.2%
    - Rest : 4.6%

## Determinants of Health Inequities
- 3 forms of inequities
  1. Historical Inequities
  2. Socio-economic inequities
  3. Inequities in provision and access to health services
- Determinants for improving population health
  - Availability, accessibility, and affordability of healthcare facilities
  - Healthcare financing and provisioning arrangements

## Features of Health Service Provisioning
 - The policies and practices of the British rule
 - Inequities in availability and accessibility
 - Features during the post independence period
  - Under financed
  - Biased towards allopathic medicine, urban areas and curative services
  - Marginal role played by the indigenous systems like ayurveda, siddha, unani, and homeopathy.
  
---

- Primary level healthcare institutions
  - Sub-centres, PHC's
- Secondary level
  - Community health centres and hospitals
- Tertiary level
  - Teaching hospitals
- Inadequate expansion of facilities
- Inadequate universal coverage and access to quality care.
- Rural-urban and interstate variation in distribution of public facilities and human resources
  - Insufficient public investment
  - Failure to focus on the role and the synergies between Centre-State financing, provisioning, and administration of health services

---

- Public Insurance Schemes for employees
  - Employees' State Insurance Schemes
  - Central Government Health Scheme
  - Railways, and Posts and Telegraph Services
- Public and private insurance schemes barely cover 11% of the population (Approach Paper to the Eleventh Plan, GOI, 2006)
- The Private Sector
  - 'For profit' institutions
  - 'Not for profit' institutions
    - Community level programmes, dispensaries, and hospitals largely funded by religious and secular organisations.

**Inequities in the utilisation of Preventive Services**


<div style="float: left; width: 45%;">

- Immunisation coverage differentials across states
- Immunisation coverage differential across socio-economic groups

## Inequities in utilisation of Curative Services
- 80% dependence on the private sector for outpatient care
- Utilisation of public sector OPD
  - 2004: rural - 21%, urban - 19%
- Inpatient treatment
  - 1980s - around 60%
  - 2004 - 42% rural, 38% urban
- Mainly due to absence of strong public sector

## Affordability of health services
- Affordability is determined by
  - Cost of treatment
  - Household's ability to manage those costs
  - Its impact on the livelihood of the households
- In India, 80% of the total health expenditure and 97% of the private expenditure are borne through OOP payments
  - Large component of OOP expenditure is the medicine purchase.
  - NSSO (1999-2000): 70% of OOP expenditure in urban and 77% in rural spent on medicines.
- Socio-economic differential
  - Poorest rural quintile spends 87% of OOP expenditure on medicine and 65% by the richest urban quintile.
  
## Inequities in health expenditure burden
<div style="float: left; width: 30%;">
- Expenditure on consumption of healthcare is higher in the rural than in the urabn population.
- NSSO 2004-05 Consumption Survey
  - 6.6% of the HHs consumption was in health in the rural and 5.2% inthe urban.
  - In 1993, this was 5.5% in rural and 4.6% in urban

## Factors affecting equity in access to health services
- The five key health service factors
  1. Insufficient investments in public sector
  1. Variable quality of care in public and private sectors.
  1. Unregulated commercialisation and rising costs
  1. Health sector reforms
  1. Lack of accountability in the public and private sectors
  
## Insufficient investment
- Low public investment over the last six decades
- Low levels of per capita expenditure on health compared to other countries. [Compare using the world bank data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.CHEX.PC.CD?locations=IN-CN-GH-PK)
- Large variations in financing across states
- Expansion in the private sector.

## Unregulated commercialisation and rising costs
- Medical technology and education provisioning has been unregulated.
- The primary level  is the largest segment of the private sector that is unregulated.
- At the secondary level few regulations are in place - e.g. systems of accreditation are put in place.
  - The Clinical Establishment (Registration and Regulation) Bill 2007 seeks to regulate the private sector health institutions.
- Without proper regulation the cost of healthcare in the private sector is uncontrolled.
   - For e.g. a normal delivery in a government hospital costs INR 2100 whereas it can cost INR 15000 in a private hospital. For a c-section, it can be INR 5500 in a govt hospital and INR 33000 in a private hospital.

## The health sector reforms
- Health sector reforms were initiated as a part of the Structural Adjustment Programme of the World Bank in 1991.
- Some important measures adopted
  - Introduction of user fees.
  - Contracting out of clinical and ancillary services to the private sector.
  - Decentralisation and public-private partnerships.
- The introduction if user fees have tended to exclude the poorest.
- International evidence also points at the same direction - introduction of even a small user fee can exclude a poor from utilising health services.

## Variable quality of care in public and private sectors.
- Common complaints against public care cited in NSSO (2006) and NFHS (1998-99 and 2005-06)

<blockquote>
"Not satisfied wit the medical treatment." <br>
"Lack of availability of services" <br>
"Long waiting time" <br>
"Poor quality of care" <br>
</blockquote>
  
- Quality of health services are mainly affected by
  - technical competence
  - accessibility to services
  - interpersonal relations
  - presence of adequate drugs, supplies, staff and medical amenities.

- People generally assume that private sector offers superior quality of service
- This cannot be generalised because of heterogenity of facilities, personnel, and their practices
  - In Delhi, both private and public practitioners are more skilled and knowledgeable in the wealthier areas as compared to the poorer areas (Das and Hammer, 2007).
  - In a secondary level study in Chennai, a strong tendency to over-provide care depending upon the patients ability to pay (Muraleedharan, 1999).
  - In rural Maharashtra, only 55% of private sector had registration, only 38% maintained any kind of records, and 30% were run by doctors not trained in allopathic system of medicine.
  
## Lack of accountability in public and private sectors.
- Some key areas in public sector that lack accountability are:
  - Absenteeism of providers
  - Indifferent behaviour of service providers and corruption
- In the private sector
  - Overuse and misuse of technology
  - Unethical practices.
- Corruption in public health services
  - Bribes demanded for admission and treatment
  - Corruption in recruitment, promotion and transfer of personnel.
- Corruption in private sector
  - Unethical practices
    - Payment of commissions
